I had some ridiculously expensive leather ones that were just to darn heavy. So from now on all the bags have to me nylon, or like this one microfiber.

For whatever reason, it is difficult to find manufacturers that make shoes in my size, and even when they do, they are usually very limited in shoe lines and colors available. Sperry is no exception. Within my size, I can only choose between light tan and dark tan, the other two colors this shoe comes in is not available in my size (first complaint).\\n\\nIf the shoe line and color options weren't enough of a problem, they add a pricing issue. If you take the simple mean of the price of the light tan shoe for all sizes it is available in (not including the sizes it is not available in), the result is $81.83, rounded to the nearest cent. The price of my size 15 shoe in light tan is $99.95. This is $18.12 over the simple mean price for this color shoe. One might argue that this is because it takes more material to make. However, they offer this same shoe in light tan in a size 10 3E US for $99.95 and in a size 14 medium for $83.95. This would indicate their prices do not necessarily correlate with the amount of material used.\\n\\nSimply put, this is really annoying. Overall, Sperry is an awesome shoe, and I always have a pair on hand, but I am just starting to realize how annoying their pricing is (their available options for my size has always been annoying).\",\n","  'summary': 'Rip-off for certain sizes',\n","  'unixReviewTime': 1512000000},\n"," {'overall': 5.0,\n","  'verified': True,\n","  'reviewTime': '11 30, 2017',\n","  'reviewerID': 'A20HHN3GKPY2S7',\n","  'asin': 'B0000DCS5T',\n","  'style': {'Size:': ' 11 D(M) US', 'Color:': ' Brown'},\n","  'reviewerName': 'Brooke',\n","  'reviewText': 'quality material, genuine leather perfect fit',\n","  'summary': 'genuine leather perfect',\n","  'unixReviewTime': 1512000000},\n"," {'overall': 4.0,\n","  'verified': True,\n","  'reviewTime': '11 29, 2017',\n","  'reviewerID': 'A2MCMXU1GBH6GU',\n","  'asin': 'B0000DCS5T',\n","  'style': {'Size:': ' 11 D(M) US', 'Color:': ' Dark Tan'},\n","  'reviewerName': 'Jon',\n","  'reviewText': 'I always order a 1/2 size larger because they do not make an extra wide.

These Sperrys have excellent arch support and just as advertised, they really do mold them selves to your feet. Additionally,  they allow your feet to breathe. The overall effect is one of excellent comfort. The appearance of the Sperrys is second to none. I bought the navy blue version and they are snappy enough to wear  to a nice restaurant, or just knock around on the boat, or as every day walk around shoes.\\n\\nSomehow Sperry managed to make these shoes such that they are very comfortable to wear either with or without socks. If you want to wear these with socks and you normally wear a D width I recommend that you consider ordering these in the \"wide\" width. Even if you do not do this, however, these are pretty good when worn with socks. This is terrific. Many Sperrys simply do not feel right if you wear them with socks. I find that these are extremely comfortable to wear with socks.\\n\\nI cannot comment on the longevity issues that some of the other reviewers have mentioned. My copies of the these shoes appear to be well-made and so far have held up very well. I will update this review if I find an issue of this type down the road. But as of now, I am  finding these to be an excellent value and I will probably buy one or two more pairs. Highly recommended.

Generally, after about two months of use, the thin leather will begin to pull back from where it is glued to the sole of the show. Super annoying. Occasionally I can smooth it out and re-glue it back down. Usually, I just try to rip it out. Recently, I've taken to putting aftermarket leather insoles on top of the lousy sperry insoles, but this is not a great solution.

After suffering through the long walking tours of European cities, those cobblestones can make you feel like you're walking on glass or iron spikes.  I had to get something that would give me some relief and that relief came in the name of Keen.  I received these sandals just in time for our trip to Karlovy Vary and Prague in the Czech Republic.  They fit great, the size was spot-on, they felt cool, and kept me comfortable through the entire trip.  The adjustable strap is very handy as well.  I did notice a bit of sweating on the sole but then again the weather was pretty warm and extremely humid.  And I noticed some of the toe guard color from the inside rubbed onto my big toenails, which may have been because it was so humid, but that was a small price to pay since the discoloration came off my toenails after a couple of showers.  I initially thought these would look kind of clunky on my feet, but they actually looked pretty cool once I put them on.  Besides, anyone looking at your feet while you're walking is doing it for one of two reasons.  It's either because you're limping from pain because you wore the wrong type of shoes for the situation, or because you've got some pep in your step, in which case they want to see what the right kind of shoes look like.

The fit is pretty good.  If you\\'re dealing with large thighs these are the best bet in the largest Queen 2 size.  Texture is good.  City Beige is a little lighter then the way the picture shows and you will not get a \"sun tan\" look which I prefer but then you can\\'t have it all.  It is more neutral in appearance.  The price is reasonable when you take into account that this is a specialty size for a particular body type.',\n","  'overall': 4.0,\n","  'reviewTime': '12 12, 2017',\n","  'summary': 'good for thunder thighs',\n","  'unixReviewTime': 1513036800},\n"," {'reviewerID': 'A4IGPQOZ0F341',\n","  'asin': 'B0000ZFHOE',\n","  'reviewerName': 'kckc',\n","  'verified': True,\n","  'reviewText': 'Perfect just like all Berkshire nylons.',\n","  'overall': 5.0,\n","  'reviewTime': '07 25, 2017',\n","  'summary': 'Real beauties',\n","  'unixReviewTime': 1500940800},\n"," {'reviewerID': 'A6I69AAQR8NO0',\n","  'asin': 'B0000ZFHOE',\n","  'reviewerName': 'Broncos Fan',\n","  'verified': True,\n","  'reviewText': 'comfortable',\n","  'overall': 5.0,\n","  'reviewTime': '11 17, 2016',\n","  'summary': 'Five Stars',\n","  'unixReviewTime': 1479340800},\n"," {'reviewerID': 'A3H0N5RZHOSYIA',\n","  'asin': 'B0000ZFSFW',\n","  'reviewerName': 'Juanita Crawford',\n","  'verified': True,\n","  'reviewText': 'Nice fit and support',\n","  'overall': 5.0,\n","  'reviewTime': '02 8, 2017',\n","  'summary': 'Five Stars',\n","  'unixReviewTime': 1486512000},\n"," {'reviewerID': 'A24VXUHMXLIC8S',\n","  'asin': 'B0000ZFSFW',\n","  'reviewerName': 'fuzzy logic',\n","  'verified': True,\n","  'reviewText': \"Fit and quality are good.

I have about 387 pairs of Crocs in different variations (okay, maybe eight), but they aren\\'t THAT comfortable for serious walking (and for me, serious walking means running errands around town for three hours or going to the zoo for a half day) and not all of them are for summer.\\n\\nSo I asked my friends for recommendations and a handful of them suggested this exact pair, raving about them.

I haven\\'t had them in the water yet, but at this point I don\\'t care because they\\'re just comfy.\\n\\nThe only thing that was slightly worrisome was that I have thick ankles and the first time I attempted to put them on, it was a bit difficult--there was lots of tugging and pulling and stretching. I was honestly thinking that I might have to return them, because I was NOT going to like/want to expend that much effort in putting on shoes.

If I were to wear this over another regular shirt, it would be too tight in the chest. Material is durable and well-stitched; quite stiff until broken in. Nice, roomy pockets. Tiger stripe camo pattern perfectly matches a pair of my BDU pants from the late 1970s. The button tabs at 5 o\\'clock and 7 o\\'clock on back work well; without them, the shirt would have very ample room for those with a larger mid-section.
